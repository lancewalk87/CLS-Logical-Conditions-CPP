| -- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
|1   | Multiples of 3 and 5         | If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. |
|2   | Even Fibonacci numbers       | Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. |
|3   | Largest prime factor         | The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ? |
|4   | Largest palindrome product   | A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers. |
|5   | Smallest multiple            | 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20? |
|6   | Sum square difference        | The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385. The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. |
|7   | 10001st prime| By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10 001st prime number? |
|8   | Largest product in a series| The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832. 73167176531330624919225119674426574742355349194934969835203127745063262395783180169848018694788518438586156078911294949545950173795833195285320880551112540698747158523863050715693290963295227443043557668966489504452445231617318564030987111217223831136222989342338030813533627661428280644448664523874930358907296290491560440772390713810515859307960866701724271218839987979087922749219016997208880937766572733300105336788122023542180975125454059475224352584907711670556013604839586446706324415722155397536978179778461740649551492908625693219784686224828397224137565705605749026140797296865241453510047482166370484403199890008895243450658541227588666881164271714799244429282308634656748139191231628245861786645835912456652947654568284891288314260769004224219022671055626321111109370544217506941658960408 07198403850962455444362981230987879927244284909188845801561660979191338754992005240636899125607176060588611646710940507754100225698315520005593572972571636269561882670428252483600823257530420752963450 Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product? |
|9   | Special Pythagorean triplet| A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2. There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product abc. |
